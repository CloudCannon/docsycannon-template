1\. Click **Use this template** on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/tomrcc/docsycannon-template">GitHub</a>

2\. Select a name for your new project and click **Create repository from template**.

3\. [Sign up](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register?trial=cc_standard)&nbsp;for CloudCannon using their free trial period.

4\. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-cms---get-started-with-cloudcannon">Build your site</a>.

Once you have a copy of the template live on CloudCannon, navigate to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/editor">CloudCannon's CMS</a>&nbsp;and edit the contents to suit your needs.
