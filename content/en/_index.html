      This template website is forked from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="(https://github.com/google/docsy-example),">Docsy Example
      Website</a>, and then configured for editing in CloudCannon's CMS. Use
      this site as a template and edit the placeholder information to suit your
      needs. It also serves as a good starting point for developers who want to
      build their own customised documentation workflow for content editing in a
      CMS.
