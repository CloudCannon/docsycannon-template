      This template website is forked from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="(https://github.com/google/docsy-example),">Docsy Example
      Website</a>, and then configured for editing in CloudCannon's CMS. Use 
      this site as a template and edit the placeholder information to suit 
      your needs. It also serves as a good starting point for developers who 
      want to build their own customised documentation workflow for content 
      editing in a CMS.
